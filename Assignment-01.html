            <h1>FLex</h1>
            <P>The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among
                items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.</P>
             <p>To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with <b>display: flex;</b></p>

            <h1>Grid </h1>
            <P>CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to
                design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout allow us to
                align elements into columns and rows.

                To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and
                row sizes with <b>grid-template-columns</b> and <b>grid-template-rows</b>, and then place its child elements into the
                grid with grid-column and grid-row.</P>

            <h1>Diffrence Between Flex and Grid</h1>

                <li>1.Dimensionality and Flexibility :-</li>
                <UL>
                    <li>Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being
                        one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.</li>
                    <li>Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length.
                        This compensates for the limitations in Flex.</li>
                </UL>

                <li>2. Alignment :-</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used
                        when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to
                        automatically adjust columns or rows.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Item Management</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container
                        can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to
                        design for fluctuating screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to
                        automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation from the preceding item.
